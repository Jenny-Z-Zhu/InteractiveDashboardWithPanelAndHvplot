# Two Ways to View this Project

Welcome!

## View on Your Local Environment
Download below file to view dashboard on your local enviroment (IDE only), Jupyter Lab won't work.
- `Customer_Churn_EDA.ipynb`
- `sampled_churn_data`
   
Steps:
1. Run below in a Jupyter code block:  
```python
!pip install panel hvplot pandas numpy
```
3. Delete above code block, restart kernel and re-run entire notebook. You should have a web app (e.g. http://localhost:46713) pop up in your brower.
4. Plots rendered in outputs are for demo only, the interactive widget won't work, it will show error if you click. The complete widget can be used in final app, which is on a web host:
